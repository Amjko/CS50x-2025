# 📌 CS50x 2025
 My solutions and projects from **CS50x 2025 – Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science.** Includes problem sets, final projects, and coding exercises mostly in C, Python, SQLite, and more.

## 🚀 Features
- Problem Sets Provided by CS50x
- Solutions to Problem Sets
- Learning Notes

## ⚠️ Disclaimer 
 I do not take credit of all files and its code within directories of `Week_#-Language`. Most of all of the files came from `Problem Sets` provided by **CS50x 2025** for the purpose of the enrolled students to complete the code, following a set of instructions.

## 📝 Note
> 1. All folders with the name `Tests` either consist of (or consist of multiple):
> - Files for testing code.
> - Failures to solve problem set provided by CS50.
> - Notes related to solving problem set.
> - Notes related to introduced concept/code/syntax by CS50 related to that week's programming language.
> 2. Many, if not, all of the C files do not work due to the inclusion of CS50 header, which is not a standard library provided by C compiler.
> 3.
