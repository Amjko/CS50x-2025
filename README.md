## 📌 About
 My solutions and projects from **CS50x 2025 – Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science.** Includes problem sets, final projects, and coding exercises mostly in C, Python, SQLite, and more.

## CS50x 2025
 [**CS50x**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/) is Harvard University’s Introduction to Computer Science, a free online course available on [**edX**](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science). It is designed for beginners with no prior coding experience and covers fundamental programming and computer science concepts.

## 🚀 Features
- Problem Sets Provided by CS50x
- Solutions to Problem Sets
- Learning Notes

## ⚠️ Disclaimer 
 I do not take credit of all files and its code within directories of `Week_#-Language`. Most of all of the files came from problem sets provided by CS50x 2025 for the purpose of the enrolled students to complete the code, following a set of instructions.

 Moreover, if you are an enrolled student at CS50x 2025 and not yet have finished the course, **DO NOT** open directories of `Week_#-Language`, for these contain files that have completed the problem sets.

## 📝 Note
> 1. All folders with the name `Tests` either consist of (or consist of multiple):
> - Files for testing code.
> - Failures to solve problem set provided by CS50.
> - Notes related to solving problem set.
> - Notes related to introduced concept/code/syntax by CS50 related to that week's programming language.
> 2. Many, if not, all of the C files do not work due to the inclusion of CS50 header, which is not a standard library provided by C compiler.
> 3. I will not accept any requests in updating C files, unless I feel like improving the code.
