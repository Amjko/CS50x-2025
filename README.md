# CS50x 2025
 My solutions and projects from CS50x 2025 â€“ Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science. Includes problem sets, final projects, and coding exercises mostly in C, Python, SQLite., and more.

## Features
- Problem Sets Provided by CS50x
- Solutions to Problem Sets
- Learning Notes

## Note
> All folders with the name `Tests` either consist of (or consist of multiple):
> 1. Files for testing code.
> 2. Failures to solve problem set provided by CS50.
> 3. Notes related to solving problem set.
> 4. Notes related to introduced concept/code/syntax by CS50 related to that week's programming language.
> ---
> Many, if not, all of the C files do not work due to the inclusion of CS50 header, which is not a standard library provided by C compiler.
