If songs.db contained the top 100 songs of a listener from 2018, with having just the energy, valence, and danceability per song, I would characterized their audio aura by getting the average of the three values from the top a hundred songs. In which, I would use those average values in some sort of algorithm to determine the listener's audio aura.

Though, this wouldn't be as "accurate" or "representative" of the listener, for I am missing one key value that should be included in calculating the audio aura, which is the number of times they've played a particular song. Not just directly the amount of times they've played a song, but rather emphasize the energy, valence, and danceability of those most-played songs.
